Insights Summary

Over the 30-day period analyzed, several key observations were made:

Price Trend: XRP/USDT experienced moderate price fluctuations, with both upward and downward movements that lacked a sustained trend direction.

Daily Returns: The returns were relatively volatile on certain days, indicating short-term speculative activity in the market. There were a few spikes and dips, but no strong momentum.

Moving Averages (MA): The 5-day and 15-day moving averages occasionally crossed paths, which could be early signals of short-term price shifts. However, the crossovers did not consistently align with strong price movements.

Volatility: The 7-day rolling volatility showed noticeable increases around specific dates, suggesting heightened uncertainty or trading volume during those periods. For instance, volatility peaked near the middle of the month, which may be tied to broader market sentiment or news events.

These insights can serve as the basis for further exploration, such as developing simple trading signals or comparing XRPâ€™s behavior with other crypto assets over the same period.
